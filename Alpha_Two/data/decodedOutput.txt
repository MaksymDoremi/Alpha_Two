gst 25 1991 dear friend i am writing to you because she said you listen and understand and didn’t try to sleep with that person at that party even though you could have Pls don’t try to fgr out who she is because then you might fgr out who i am and i really don’t want you to do that i will call people by dffrnt names or gnrc names because i don’t want you to find me i didn’t ncls a return address for the same rsn i mean nothing bad by this Honest i just need to know that smn out there listens and ndrstnds and doesn’t try to sleep with people even if they could have i need to know that these people exist i think you of all people would understand that because i think you of all people are lv and pprct what that means at least i hope you do because other people look to you for strength and frndshp and it’s that simple at least that’s what I’ve heard so this is my life and i want you to know that i am both happy and sad and i’m still trying to fgr out how that could be i try to think of my family as a rsn for me being this way spclly after my friend michael stopped going to school one day last spring and we heard mr Vaughn’s vc on the ldspkr “Boys and girls i regret to inform you that one of our students has passed on we will hold a mmrl srvc for michael Dobson during assembly this Friday ” i don’t know how news travels around school and why it is very often right maybe it was in the lnchrm it’s hard to rmmbr but Dave with the awkward glasses told us that michael killed himself his mom played bridge with one of Mchl’s nghbrs and they heard the gunshot i don’t really rmmbr much of what happened after that except that my older brother came to mr Vaughn’s ffc in my middle school and told me to stop crying then he put his arm on my shldr and told me to get it out of my system bfr dad came home we then went to eat french fries at McDonald’s and he taught me how to play pinball he even made a joke that because of me he got to skip an ftrnn of school and asked me if i wanted to help him work on his camaro i guess i was pretty messy because he never let me work on his camaro bfr at the guidance counselor sssns they asked the few of us who ctlly liked michael to say a few words i think they were frd that some of us would try to kill rslvs or something because they looked very tense and one of them kept tchng his beard Bridget who is crazy said that smtms she thought about scd when cmmrcls come on during TV she was sncr and this puzzled the guidance cnslrs Carl who is nice to vryn said that he felt very sad but could never kill himself because it is a sin this one guidance counselor went through the whole group and finally came to me “What do you think charlie ” what was so strange about this was the fact that i had never met this man because he was a “spclst” and he knew my name even though i wasn’t wrng a name tag like they do in open house “Well i think that michael was a nice guy and i don’t understand why he did it as much as i feel sad i think that not knowing is what really bothers me ” i just rrd that and it doesn’t sound like how i talk spclly in that ffc because i was crying still i never did stop crying the counselor said that he sspctd that michael had “problems at home” and didn’t feel like he had nyn to talk to that’s maybe why he felt all ln and killed himself then i started scrmng at the guidance counselor that michael could have talked to me and i started crying even harder he tried to calm me down by saying that he meant an adult like a teacher or a guidance counselor but it didn’t work and vntlly my brother came by the middle school in his camaro to pick me up for the rest of the school year the tchrs trtd me dffrnt and gave me better grades even though i didn’t get any smarter to tell you the truth i think i made them all nrvs Mchl’s fnrl was strange because his father didn’t cry and three months later he left Mchl’s mom at least ccrdng to Dave at lnchtm i think about it smtms i wonder what went on in Mchl’s house around dinner and TV shows michael never left a note or at least his parents didn’t let nyn see it maybe it was “problems at home ” i wish i knew it might make me miss him more clearly it might have made sad sense one thing i do know is that it makes me wonder if i have “problems at home” but it seems to me that a lot of other people have it a lot worse like when my sister’s first byfrnd started going around with another girl and my sister cried for the whole wknd my dad said “There are other people who have it a lot worse ” and my mom was qt and that was that a month later my sister met another boy and started playing happy records again and my dad kept working and my mom kept swpng and my brother kept fixing his camaro that is until he left for cllg at the bgnnng of the summer He’s playing football for Penn State but he ndd the summer to get his grades right to play football i don’t think that there is a favorite kid in our family there are three of us and i am the yngst my brother is the oldest he is a very good football player and likes his car my sister is very pretty and mean to boys and she is in the middle i get straight A’s now like my sister and that is why they lv me ln my mom cries a lot during TV programs my dad works a lot and is an honest man my aunt helen used to say that my dad was going to be too proud to have a mdlf crisis it took me until around now to understand what she meant by that because he just turned forty and nothing has changed my aunt helen was my favorite person in the whole world she was my mom’s sister she got straight A’s when she was a tngr and she used to give me books to read my father said that the books were a little too old for me but i liked them so he just shrugged and let me read my aunt helen lived with the family for the last few years of her life because something very bad happened to her Nobody would tell me what happened then even though i always wanted to know when i was around seven i stopped asking about it because i kept asking like kids always do and my aunt helen started crying very hard that’s when my dad slapped me saying “Y’r hurting your aunt Helen’s flngs ” i didn’t want to do that so i stopped aunt helen told my father not to hit me in front of her ever again and my father said this was his house and he would do what he wanted and my mom was qt and so were my brother and sister i don’t rmmbr much more than that because i started crying really hard and after a while my dad had my mom take me to my room it wasn’t until much later that my mom had a few glasses of white wine and told me what happened to her sister some people really do have it a lot worse than i do they really do i should probably go to sleep now it’s very late i don’t know why i wrote a lot of this down for you to read the rsn i wrote this letter is because i start high school tmrrw and i am really frd of going love always charlie september like 1991 dear friend i do not like high school the cftr is called the “Ntrtn Center ” which is strange there is this one girl in my advanced english class named susan in middle school susan was very fun to be around she liked mvs and her brother Frank made her tapes of this great music that she shared with us but over the summer she had her braces taken off and she got a little taller and prttr and grew breasts now she acts a lot dumber in the hallways spclly when boys are around and i think it’s sad because susan doesn’t look as happy to tell you the truth she doesn’t like to admit she’s in the advanced english class and she doesn’t like to say “hi” to me in the hall nymr when susan was at the guidance counselor mtng about michael she said that michael once told her that she was the prttst girl in the whole world braces and all then he asked her to “go with him ” which was a big deal at any school they call it “going out” in high school and they kissed and talked about mvs and she missed him terribly because he was her best friend it’s funny too because boys and girls normally weren’t best friends around my school but michael and susan were Kind of like my aunt helen and me i’m sorry “My aunt helen and i ” that’s one thing i lrnd this week that and more cnsstnt pncttn i keep qt most of the time and only one kid named sean really smd to ntc me he wtd for me after gym class and said really mmtr things like how he was going to give me a “swrl ” which is where smn sticks your head in the tlt and flushes to make your hair swirl around he smd pretty unhappy as well and i told him so then he got mad and started hitting me and i just did the things my brother taught me to do my brother is a very good fighter “Go for the knees throat and eyes ” and i did and i really hurt sean and then i started crying and my sister had to lv her snr honors class and drive me home i got called to mr Small’s ffc but i didn’t get sspndd or anything because a kid told mr Small the truth about the fight “Sean started it it was slf-dfns ” and it was i just don’t understand why sean wanted to hurt me i didn’t do anything to him i am very small that’s true but i guess sean didn’t know i could fight the truth is i could have hurt him a lot worse and maybe i should have i thought i might have to if he came after the kid who told mr Small the truth but sean never did go after him so vrythng was frgttn some kids look at me strange in the hallways because i don’t dcrt my locker and i’m the one who beat up sean and couldn’t stop crying after he did it i guess i’m pretty mtnl it has been very lonely because my sister is busy being the oldest one in our family my brother is busy being a football player at Penn State after the trnng camp his coach said that he was second string and that when he starts lrnng the system he will be first string my dad really hopes he will make it to the pros and play for the Stlrs my mom is just glad he gets to go to cllg for free because my sister doesn’t play football and there wouldn’t be ngh money to send both of them that’s why she wants me to keep working hard so I’ll get an cdmc schlrshp so that’s what i’m doing until i meet a friend here i was hoping that the kid who told the truth could bcm a friend of mine but i think he was just being a good guy by telling love always charlie september 11 1991 dear friend i don’t have a lot of time because my advanced english teacher ssgnd us a book to read and i like to read books twice ncdntlly the book is to kill a mockingbird if you haven’t read it i think you should because it is very ntrstng the teacher has ssgnd us a few chapters at a time but i do not like to read books like that i am halfway through the first time Anyway the rsn i am writing to you is because i saw my brother on tlvsn i normally don’t like sports too much but this was a spcl ccsn my mother started crying and my father put his arm around her shldr and my sister smiled which is funny because my brother and sister always fight when he’s around but my older brother was on tlvsn and so far it has been the highlight of my two weeks in high school i miss him terribly which is strange because we never really talked much when he was here we still don’t talk to be honest i would tell you his pstn but like i said i would like to be nnyms to you i hope you understand love always charlie september 16 1991 dear friend i have fnshd to kill a mockingbird it is now my favorite book of all time but then again i always think that until i read another book my advanced english teacher asked me to call him “Bill” when we’re not in class and he gave me another book to read he says that i have a great skill at rdng and ndrstndng lngg and he wanted me to write an essay about to kill a mockingbird i mntnd this to my mom and she asked why bill didn’t rcmmnd that i just take a sphmr or jnr english class and i told her that bill said that these were bsclly the same classes with more cmplctd books and that it wouldn’t help me my mom said that she wasn’t sure and would talk to him during open house then she asked me to help her by washing the dishes which i did Honestly i don’t like doing dishes i like tng with my fingers and off napkins but my sister says that doing so is bad for the nvrnmnt she is a part of the Earth Day Club here in high school and that is where she meets the boys they are all very nice to her and i don’t really understand why except maybe the fact that she is pretty she really is mean to these boys one boy has it prtclrly hard i won’t tell you his name but i will tell you all about him he has very nice brown hair and he wears it long with a pnytl i think he will regret this when he looks back on his life he is always making mix tapes for my sister with very spcfc themes one was called “tmn Lvs ” he ncldd many songs by the Smiths he even hnd-clrd the cover after the movie he rented was over and he left my sister gave me the tape “Do you want this charlie ” i took the tape but i felt weird about it because he had made it for her but i lstnd to it and loved it very much there is one song called “slp” that i would like you to listen to i told my sister about it and a week later she thanked me because when this boy asked her about the tape she said exactly what i said about the song “slp ” and this boy was very moved by how much it meant to her i hope this means i will be good at dating when the time comes i should stick to the subject though that is what my teacher bill tells me to do because i write kind of the way i talk i think that is why he wants me to write that essay about to kill a mockingbird this boy who likes my sister is always rspctfl to my parents my mom likes him very much because of this my dad thinks he’s soft i think that’s why my sister does what she does to him this one night she was saying very mean things about how he didn’t stand up to the class bully when he was fftn or something like that to tell you the truth i was just watching the movie he had rented so i wasn’t paying very close ttntn to their fight they fight all the time so i fgrd that the movie was at least something dffrnt which it wasn’t because it was a sql Anyway after she lnd into him for about four movie scenes which i guess is about ten mnts or so he started crying crying very hard then i turned around and my sister pntd at me “You see even charlie stood up to his bully you see ” and this guy got really rd-fcd and he looked at me then he looked at her and he wound up and hit her hard across the face i mean hard i just froze because i couldn’t blv he did it it was not like him at all to hit anybody he was the boy that made mix tapes with themes and hnd-clrd covers until he hit my sister and stopped crying the weird part is that my sister didn’t do anything she just looked at him very qtly it was so weird my sister goes crazy if you eat the wrong kind of tuna but here was this guy hitting her and she didn’t say anything she just got soft and nice and she asked me to lv which i did after the boy had left she said that they were “going out” and not to tell mom or dad what happened i guess he stood up to his bully and i guess that makes sense that wknd my sister spent a lot of time with this boy and they lghd a lot more than they slly did on Friday night i was rdng my new book but my brain got tired so i dcdd to watch some tlvsn nstd and i pnd the door to the bsmnt and my sister and this boy were naked he was on top of her and her legs were draped over thr side of the couch and she scrmd at me in a whisper “Get out you pervert ” so i left the next day we all watched my brother play football and my sister nvtd this boy over i am not sure when he left the prvs night they held hands and acted like vrythng was happy and this boy said something about how the football team hasn’t been the same since my brother grdtd and my dad thanked him and when the boy left my dad said that this boy was bcmng a fine young man who could carry himself and my mom was qt and my sister looked at me to make sure i wouldn’t say anything and that was that “Yes he is ” that’s all my sister could say and i could see this boy at home doing his hmwrk and thinking about my sister naked and i could see them holding hands at football games that they do not watch and i could see this boy throwing up in the bushes at a party house and i could see my sister putting up with it and i felt very bad for both of them love always charlie september 18 1991 dear friend i never told you that i am in shop class did i Well i am in shop class and it is my favorite class next to Bill’s advanced english class i wrote the essay for to kill a mockingbird last night and i handed it in to bill this morning we are sppsd to talk about it tmrrw during lunch prd the point though is that there is a guy in shop class named “Nothing ” i’m not kidding his name is “Nothing ” and he is hlrs “Nothing” got his name when kids used to ts him in middle school i think he’s a snr now the kids started calling him Patty when his real name is Patrick and “Nothing” told these kids “Listen you thr call me Patrick or you call me nothing ” so the kids started calling him “Nothing ” and the name just stuck he was a new kid in the school district at the time because his dad mrrd a new woman in this much i think i will stop putting qttn marks around Nothing’s name because it is nnyng and dsrptng my flow i hope you do not find this dffclt to follow i will make sure to dffrntt if something comes up so in shop class nothing started to do a very funny mprsntn of our teacher mr Cllhn he even pntd in the mttnchp sdbrns with a grs pencil Hlrs when mr Cllhn found nothing doing this near the belt sander he ctlly lghd because nothing wasn’t doing the mprsntn mean or anything it was just that funny i wish you could have been there because it was the hardest I’ve lghd since my brother left my brother used to tell Polish jokes which i know is wrong but i just blocked out the Polish part and lstnd to the jokes Hlrs Oh ncdntlly my sister asked for her “tmn Lvs” mix tape back she listens to it all the time now love always charlie september 29 1991 dear friend there is a lot to tell you about the last two weeks a lot of it is good but a lot of it is bad again i don’t know why this always happens First of all bill gave me a think on my to kill a mockingbird essay because he said that i run my sntncs tgthr i am trying now to prctc not to do that he also said that i should use the vcblry words that i learn in class like “crplnt” and “jndc ” i would use them here but i really don’t think they are pprprt in this format to tell you the truth i don’t know where they are pprprt to use i’m not saying that you shouldn’t know them you should bsltly but i just have never heard nyn use the words “crplnt” and “jndc” ever in my life that nclds tchrs so what’s the point of using words nobody else knows or can say cmfrtbly i just don’t understand that i feel the same way about some movie stars who are trrbl to watch some of these people must have a mlln dollars at least and yet they keep doing these mvs they blow up bad guys they yell at their dtctvs they do ntrvws for mgzns Every time i see this one prtclr movie star on a mgzn i can’t help but feel terribly sorry for her because nobody respects her at all and yet they keep ntrvwng her and the ntrvws all say the same thing
